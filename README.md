# 🔗 Graph RAG - Interactive Knowledge Graph Prototype

An interactive frontend prototype that visually demonstrates a Knowledge Graph powered Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

## ✨ Features

- 📄 **Document Upload & Chunking** — Upload files and see simulated chunk extraction with embeddings
- 🕸️ **Interactive Knowledge Graph** — D3.js force-directed graph (Neo4j-style) with drag, zoom, tooltips
- 🔍 **Graph RAG Pipeline** — Step-by-step animated query → reasoning → answer workflow
- 🎥 **Presentation Mode** — Guided step-by-step walkthrough for demos and pitches
- 🌙 **Dark Mode** — Modern glassmorphism SaaS aesthetic

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- HTML5 / CSS3 / Vanilla JavaScript
- D3.js (Force-directed graph visualization)
- No backend required (mock data simulation)

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
https://github.com/Thirumoorthy369/Graph-RAG.git

# Open in browser
cd Graph-RAG
# Open index.html directly, or use a local server:
npx serve .
```

## 📸 Demo

Upload a document → Watch chunks extracted → See knowledge graph build → Ask questions → Get RAG answers
